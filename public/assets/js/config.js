Archer rewards map awareness, target selection and clean movement.", pvpAdvantage: "Excellent range, safe poke and strong pick potential against low-health targets.", pvpDisadvantage: "Vulnerable when melee classes close the gap or when caught without room to reposition." },

Swordsman is ideal for players who want to anchor pushes, peel for allies and survive extended fights.", pvpAdvantage: "High survivability and strong frontline control make it reliable in group clashes.", pvpDisadvantage: "Lower chase speed and burst compared with pure DPS classes, so mobile targets can escape." },

Shaman shines when playing behind the frontline, keeping key allies alive and turning long fights through timing and positioning.", pvpAdvantage: "Valuable in organized PvP because utility and sustain can swing extended team fights", pvpDisadvantage: "Needs protection and careful positioning; focused burst or silence pressure can shut it down quickly." },

Extreme is best for players who like switching targets and creating chaos during crowded fights.", pvpAdvantage: "Versatile damage profile and disruptive pressure work well in messy group battles.", pvpDisadvantage: "Can feel less specialized than pure classes, and poor cooldown timing leaves it exposed." },

Gunner thrives when firing from protected angles and punishing enemies who commit too deep.", pvpAdvantage: "Strong sustained ranged damage and good backline threat in team fights.", pvpDisadvantage: "Needs space and protection; collapses quickly when surrounded or forced into close combat." },

Assassin rewards patience, timing and reading the fight before committing.", pvpAdvantage: "Exceptional burst and backline threat against supports, archers and isolated carries.", pvpDisadvantage: "Punishing to misplay; if the opening burst fails, it can be controlled and eliminated fast." }
